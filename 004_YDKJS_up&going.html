// Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop! until you run out of money in your bank account. You’ll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.

//After you’ve calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.

// Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.

// You should set up some constants for the “tax rate,” “phone price,” “accessory price,” and “spending threshold,” as well as a variable for your “bank account balance.”

//You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a “$” and rounding to two decimal places.

// Bonus Challenge: Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the prompt(..) covered in “Input” on page 6. You may prompt the user for their bank

const taxRate = 0.08;
const phonePrice = 99;
const accessoryPrice = 10;
const spendingThreshold = 200;

let bankBalance = 303.91;
let amount = 0;

function calculateTax(amount) {
    return amount * taxRate
}

function formatAmount(amount) {
    return "$" + amount.toFixed(2);
}

while (amount < bankBalance) {
    amount = amount + phonePrice; 
} if (amount < spendingThreshold) {
    amount = amount + accessoryPrice; 
}

amount = amount + calculateTax(amount); 

if (amount > bank_balance) {
    console.log(`You can't afford it.`)
}
